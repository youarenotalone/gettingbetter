<h3>Birds and bees and snails</h3>

Can't believe I haven't written this down before... one of my strongest memories from childhood.

Age 9? 10? 8? Playing in the backyard, alone. Looking for rolly-pollies, snails, etc. Over by the downspout. Hearing a bird.

<p>
Thinking "I wish I were a bird." Not because they can fly.
</p><p>
"Because I think they don't think about things too much. They seem pretty happy — they chirp, sing, get to fly. They do have to find food every day, and sometimes worry about other animals catching them. It's nice that I don't have to worry about those things — mom and dad take care of things like that. But I'd rather do that for a few years than be stuck with life as a human. Birds, frogs, snails... only live a few years, right? Humans live to be 70 or 80 or 90 — that means I have like 70 more years of this!"
</p>

<p>"How did I get stuck in this situation? Mom and Dad. Why'd they have to have me? Why would any adult think it's a good idea to bring someone into the world? Life is hard, and goes on for so long. Even when there're good times, they don't out-weigh the bad times; and wouldn't it just be way better to not have been born at all?"
</p>

<p>"But so many people do have kids — there are so many humans! All my friends' parents decided to have kids. (Duh.) I didn't know too many adults who decided not to have kids.
</p>

<p>Economy got bad. Dad lost his job. He got some part time, but never got another permanent one. Money was tight. Somehow dad could always find enough to keep plenty of whiskey in the pantry. Even though he went through it pretty quickly. Dad got mad a lot. Often at us — seemed like no dinner hour was exempt from a one-way yelling match across the table. He'd shout exasperated questions at us; sometimes we tried to answer; but all the answers were always wrong. So I mostly ate silently and avoided eye contact. But I hated it most when he got mad at Mom. Why would he yell at her like that? It wasn't her fault we didn't have much money. That happened a lot at night after we'd gone to bed. We slept with the door cracked, and my bed was near the door, so I could hear them loud and clear. (Well, dad anyway.) Seemed like it went on for hours. Mom never yelled back at him — she just took it. She did get mad at us a fair amount. We got spanked regularly — yardstick, wooden spoon, fly swatter, hands. "Wait til your dad gets home!" was always a terrorizing one. Then there's the classic "I'll give you something to cry about!" (Not just a joke — they literally said that!) Sometimes my older brother and I got spanked because we were arguing or fighting with each other. I eventually realized that fighting back wasn't working out that well, so I tried curling up and taking the punches. But then sometimes I got spanked anyway, so that didn't work out that well either.
</p>

<p>Walking by the parents' room one time: mom was in there alone; she didn't know anyone could hear her. "Sometimes I wish I never had children."
</p>


<p>When I was four and a half my sister was born. We were pretty smitten by her. Before she was walking we'd put her in a laundry basket and drag her smiling down the hallway or across the lawn. We'd tickle her tummy and play with her hair.
</p>

<p>When I was nine and a half our parents told us that we'd have a fourth sibling. I remember the pit of my stomach falling. I went to my room and wondered "How could they do this again? How are we going to take care of another mouth to feed?" Once he was born I never, ever resented my little brother — we adored him like crazy.
</p>


<p>When we were ten and nine my older brother and I decided we were going to get jobs. Well, he decided, and I was certainly going to get a job if he was getting one, nevermind that he'd reached double-digits already and I hadn't. At the time I didn't realize that this was probably an attempt to carry our weight in the family money situation. For the first half year I saved up my money to buy a bike. (Which, ironically, I didn't really get to choose. I wanted lots of gears for the big hills on the paper route, and I wanted one that fit me well. My parents thought all those gears would be confusing [super ironic, in retrospect], and — like everything we got — that I should get one that was about two sizes too big, so I could grow into it and not have to get another one for a long time. The bike was hard to ride up the hills, hard to get on and off, and often fell over because the kickstand was a bit too long. I hated that bike, and was sad that that's where all my money went.) Anyway, I would continue that paper route for the next 9 years (in addition to other jobs I got during the summer and winter vacations), waking up at 5:53 so I could have them delivered by the deadline. Mom helped us sometimes — especially Sundays when the papers where enormous. Dad never did.  One evening — I think it wasn't too long into the paperboy career — I heard dad fiercely haranguing mom over money, and I vowed to turn over every penny I made to mom so that she'd have more money to buy food and stuff. (Full disclosure: instead of doing that, I just used it to buy groceries when I got them on my bike; and to buy my school clothes.) (Sidebar: I haven't been unemployed since! Nor spent much time on vacation. Probably should change that.)
</p>

<p>
I didn't realize until I was an adult that so many of these things happened around the same time. I'm not sure of the exact order, or how much time in between, and I'm definitely not saying that there's a direct line between any or all these things: dad lost job; dad drank more and shouted more; we got slapped a lot; little brother was born; we went to work; I heard the birds in the backyard and wished I hadn't been born. For most of my life I didn't see any connections between any of them (except maybe the drinking and the shouting).
</p>


<p>I know life isn't like this for everyone. And we are not our parents. We can do better. And I know how fortunate and blessed my life has been — so many people have so much more pain and suffering. But even with the best intentions, so many things can go wrong. Better to call the whole thing off?

<h3>Grown up, relationships</h3>

<p>Sometimes you meet a truly wonderful person — someone you respect and admire in every possible way. Who is kind, sexy, makes you laugh, admires and repects you in kind. Sometimes you have all that, but you have different ideas about how to build families. It's hard to compromise on that. Better to acknowledge the differences, shed a tear, move onward separately. But also relish the wonder that was, treasure it always as a warm spot in your life and heart.
