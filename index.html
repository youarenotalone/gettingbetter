<h3>Birds and bees and snails</h3>

Can't believe I haven't written this down before... one of my strongest memories from childhood.

Age 9? 10? 8? Playing in the backyard, alone. Looking for rolly-pollies, snails, etc. Over by the downspout. Hearing a bird.

<p>
Thinking "I wish I were a bird." Not because they can fly.
</p><p>
"Because I think they don't think about things too much. They seem pretty happy - they chirp, sing, get to fly. They do have to find food every day, and sometimes worry about other animals catching them. It's nice that I don't have to worry about those things - mom and dad take care of things like that. But I'd rather do that for a few years than be stuck with life as a human. Birds, frogs, snails... only live a few years, right? Humans live to be 70 or 80 or 90 - that means I have like 70 more years of this!"
</p>

<p>"How did I get stuck in this situation? Mom and Dad. Why'd they have to have me? Why would any adult think it's a good idea to bring someone into the world? Life is hard, and goes on for so long. Even when there're good times, they don't out-weigh the bad times; and wouldn't it just be way better to not have been born at all?"
</p>

<p>"But so many people do have kids - there are so many humans! All my friends' parents decided to have kids. (Duh.) I didn't know too many adults who decided not to have kids.
</p>

<p>Economy got bad. Dad lost his job; couldn't get another good one. Money was tight. Dad got mad a lot. At us; but I hated it most when he got mad at Mom. Why would he yell at her like that? It wasn't her fault we didn't have much money. Mom never yelled back at him - she just took it. She did get mad at us. We got spanked regularly - yardstick, wooden spoon, fly swatter, hands. "Wait til your dad gets home!" "I'll give you something to cry about!" Most of the time my older brother and I got spanked because we were arguing or fighting with each other. I eventually realized that fighting back wasn't working out that well, so I tried curling up and taking the punches. But then sometimes I got spanked anyway, so that didn't work out that well either."
</p>

<p>Overheard: I walked by the parents' room one time; mom was in there alone; she didn't know anyone could hear her. "Sometimes I wish I never had children."
</p>

<p>I know life isn't like this for everyone. And we are not our parents. We can do better. But I've actually been very fortunate - so many people have so much more pain and suffering. So many things can go wrong. Better to call the whole thing off?

<h3>Grown up, relationships</h3>

<p>Sometimes you meet a truly wonderful person - someone you respect and admire in every possible way. Who is kind, sexy, makes you laugh, admires and repects you in kind. Sometimes you have all that, but you have different ideas about how to build families. It's hard to compromise on that. Better to acknowledge the differences, shed a tear, move onward separately. But also relish the wonder that was, treasure it always as a warm spot in your life and heart.
