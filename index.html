<h3>Birds and bees and snails</h3>

Can't believe I haven't written this down before... one of my strongest memories from childhood.

Age 9? 10? 8? Playing in the backyard, alone. Looking for rolly-pollies, snails, etc. Over by the downspout. Hearing a bird.

<p>
Thinking "I wish I were a bird." Not because they can fly.
</p><p>
"Because I think they don't think about things too much. They seem pretty happy - they chirp, sing, get to fly. They do have to find food every day, and sometimes worry about other animals catching them. It's nice that I don't have to worry about those things - mom and dad take care of things like that. But I'd rather do that for a few years than be stuck with life as a human. Birds, frogs, snails... only live a few years, right? Humans live to be 70 or 80 or 90 - that means I have like 70 more years of this!"
</p>

<p>"How did I get stuck in this situation? Mom and Dad. Why'd they have to have me? Why would any adult think it's a good idea to bring someone into the world? Life is hard, and goes on for so long. Even when there're good times, they don't out-weigh the bad times; and wouldn't it just be way better to not have been born at all?
